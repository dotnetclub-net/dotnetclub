----------------------

**Welcome to the dotnetClub.net project. [点此查看中文说明](https://github.com/jijiechen/dotnetclub/blob/dev/readme.md)。**

This project is source code for a discussion website, it demonstrates how ASP.NET Core can be used to make a user generated web application. The online instance of this project is hosted at [dotnetclub.net](http://dotnetclub.net) which is exactly a real community for discussing .NET Core technical topics.

This project is a web application based on the [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) open source and cross platform framework. This project will run on [.net core](https://dotnet.github.io/) runtime, but the devlopment tasks still rely on full CLR frameworks(.NET Frmework on Windows and Mono on other systems).

### Using the source

First, clone this repository and compile it to get everything ready:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jijiechen/dotnetclub.git
cd dotnetclub
```

You can work on the source with any text editor or IDE. This project uses the [cakebuild](https://cakebuild.net) as a build tool. Please change the `./build` in sample commands on this page to corresponding cakebuild entrypoint file: 

* Windows: `build.ps1`
* Linux: `build-linux.sh`
* macOS: `build.sh`

To restore packages and compile:

```sh
./build --target=build    # you may need to change the entrypoint file name
```

To execute tests:

```sh
./build --target=test   # you may need to change the entrypoint file name
```

&nbsp;

### Installation

It's recommended to run this application using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can run the application using this command after docker is installed:

```sh
docker run -d --name club -p 5000:5000 jijiechen/dotnetclub:201810130856
```

You can also compile and run it locally, in that case you'll need .NET Core SDK and node.js tools, and also Mono if you are not working on a Windows PC. After you get a good environment, it's pretty simple to run locally when following these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jijiechen/dotnetclub.git
cd dotnetclub
./build --target=ci  # you may need to change the entrypoint file name 
cd src/Discussion.Web/publish
dotnet ./Discussion.Web.dll
```

By default, the application will generate a temporary Sqlite database, which will be deleted on process exiting.  If you want to persiste your data, please configure your connection string in configuration files (`appsettings.json`, or `appsettings.<env>.js`)
